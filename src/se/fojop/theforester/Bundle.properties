    This lib is used for loading grass. \
    It will later also be used for trees.\n\n\
    Info and a tutorial can be found at: http://jmonkeyengine.org/wiki/doku.php/jme3:contributions:vegetationsystem\n\nCHANGELOG:\n\n|||||||| Version 0.1.9 ||||||||\n\nThis is the last unstable beta release. \
    There will be no 0.2.0. \
    When this version has been run for some time and is considered relatively bug free, the lib will be released as Beta 1.0.0. \
    Any major features not implemented by then will be added in 1.1.0, 1.2.0 etc.\n\n\
    Trees:\n\n** Tree-batches now has collision meshes. \
    They are generated upon loading, and are added/removed to the physics-space just as the geometry is added/removed to the scene.\n\n** Densitymaps can now be used to generate trees, just like the grass. \
    It seems to be working well but more extensive testing is needed, so there will be no mention of this in the tutorial yet.\n\n\
    NOTE: The non-batched tree alternative has been suspended, but will be put back later. \
    In the future they will be treated as regular geometry and there will be a default geometry tile-loader available for such. \
    There will be no impostors, fading or other tree-specific stuff for those types of objects; at least not initially.\n\n\
    Grass:\n\n** Made the density map index/channel settings for grass layers significantly more flexible. \
    It is now possible to add any number of densitymaps to the mapgrid, and specify for each grass layer which map to use and what color channel. \
    They can be used and shared between layers in any way. \
    If no densitymap-data is set, the layer will default to densitymap 0, and Channel.Luminance (grayscale values basically).\n\n\
    **Added a new self-shadowing option in the vertex shader, and removed the vertex color one. \
    This is just a crude system atm., and it needs more work, but it will replace the static vertex color self-shadowing. \
    It is disabled per default, but can be enabled as any other material option. \
    The variable is called SelfShadowing.\n\n** Removed vertex colors per default. \
    If you use vertex colormaps in the future, you have to enable VertexColors in the material. \
    Vertex colormaps are currently not stable. \
    They haven't been changed to use the new scaling system as densitymaps yet, it will be patched in very soon. \
    I will update the tutorial.\n\n\
    General:\n\n** Densitymaps are now scalable. \
    You can use a 512x512 densitymap with 256x256 tiles etc.\n\n** Memory footprint reduced. \
    The density value float arrays are now being generated on the fly instead of stored in the density map object.\n\n\n|||||||| Version 0.1.8 ||||||||\n\n** Trees has been added. \
    The tutorial has been updated.\n\n** Lots of new options has been added, mostly affecting the way density data is provided to the grassloader. \
    The tutorial has been updated. \n\n** Tiles can now be reloaded at runtime. \
    This will be extended later.\n\n** The grassloaders has been merged into one single class. \
    There is no longer ProceduralGrassLoader and GrassGrid, only GrassLoader.\n\n** The grass material now uses a custom class. \
    This is the first step towards a single pass material system, to avoid having to do multiple fading/animation calculations with several lights. \
    This will be used for trees as well, later.
