OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This lib is used for loading grass. \
    It will later also be used for trees.\n\n\
    Info and a tutorial can be found at: http://jmonkeyengine.org/wiki/doku.php/jme3:contributions:vegetationsystem:grass\n\nCHANGELOG:\n\nVersion 0.1.6\n\n** Re-worked the GrassGrid class. \
    Grass pages should now tile properly.\n\n** Re-worked parts of the GrassGeometryGenerator class. \
    Faster loading speed and smoother transitioning is the result of this change.\n\n** Added single pass per-vertex lighting to the shaders. \
    It supports directional lights, point lights and spotlights. \
    It is enabled/disabled by checking the "VertexLighting" box in the material editor.\n\n\
    NOTE: It does not support ambient lights at this point, and it's not even possible to have lighting on when an ambient light is in the scene. \
    This will be fixed in the next update (may have to resort to multi-pass).\n\n** Added some new resources. \
    These can be accessed from the Resources catalogue. \
    It includes a crappy daisy + impostor (lower res version) used for billboarding.\n\n** Changed the name of the nb library to Forester_Beta_1
