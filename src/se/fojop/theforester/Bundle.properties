    This lib is used for loading grass. \
    It will later also be used for trees.\n\n\
    Info and a tutorial can be found at: http://jmonkeyengine.org/wiki/doku.php/jme3:contributions:vegetationsystem\n\nCHANGELOG:\n\nVersion 0.1.8\n\nTrees:\n\n** Trees has been added. \
    The tutorial has been updated.\n\n** Lots of new options has been added, mostly affecting the way density data is provided to the grassloader. \
    The tutorial has been updated. \n\n** Tiles can be loaded/reloaded during runtime. \
    This will be further extended later.\n\n** The grassloaders has been merged into one single class. \
    There is no longer ProceduralGrassLoader and GrassGrid, only GrassLoader.\n\n** The grass material now uses a custom class. \
    This is the first step towards a single pass material system, to avoid having to do multiple fading/animation calculations with several lights. \
    This will be used for trees as well, later.
