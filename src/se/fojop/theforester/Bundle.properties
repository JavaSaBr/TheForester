    This lib is used for loading grass. \
    It will later also be used for trees.\n\n\
    Info and a tutorial can be found at: http://jmonkeyengine.org/wiki/doku.php/jme3:contributions:vegetationsystem:grass\n\nCHANGELOG:\n\nVersion 0.1.7\n\nxxxx----> NOTE: There are some major changes in this version. \
    The tutorial has been updated. \
    <----xxxx\n\n** Paging system changed. \
    Grass is now divided up into tiles, that are in turn divided up into pages. \
    This is for integrating better with the terrain system.\n\n** Density/Color map system changed. \
    On top of textures, it is now also possible to add float arrays, or RGB(A) textures with a color channel specified. \
    This is in order to use terrain alpha maps (and similar) to regulate where grass is planted. \
    Colormaps has been suspended temporarily, but will be put back in later (will patch this version a few times most likely).\n\n\
    It is also less dependent on awt, and works more like the terrain heightmap system. \
    There will be more on this feature in a subsequent update.\n\n** A normal/displacement map generator has been added. \
    This thing will be used with the trees, but is finished so its included in the lib.\n\n** Started working on the overall structure of the lib, templated lots of stuff, made the Forester class a singleton for quick access to its methods.
